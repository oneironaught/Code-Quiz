## Description

This is my first Quiz Appllate project for Rice University Coding Bootcamp.

- I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- The objective of this application is to provide questions and collect user data via Web API's to determine whether answers to the questions are correct.
- This project contains features using an array variable with interactive objects, event listeners, and a reverse count down timer.

## Website 

## Usage

- When timer is pressed, it will start a reverse count down
- When user selects the right answer, the page will display "Correct"
- When user selects the wrong answer, the page will display "Incorrect"
- The data is captured using local storage
- The final score will determine how many answers are correct  
- The final score will be displayed on the page
